# puppeteer-scraper-flask-app-docker
A multi-stage Dockerized project using Node.js with Puppeteer for headless web scraping and Python Flask to serve the scraped content via a lightweight API.

# DevOps Assignment â€“ Puppeteer Scraper + Flask API

This project demonstrates a multi-stage Docker setup:

- Uses **Node.js + Puppeteer** to scrape the `<title>` and first `<h1>` from a given webpage.
- Uses **Python + Flask** to serve the scraped data as a JSON API.
- Keeps the final Docker image lean by excluding unnecessary build tools.
